# Bullet Points

* avoiding global namespace pollution
* making our dependencies explicit
* Another thing to note is that CommonJS takes a server-first approach and synchronously loads modules. This matters because if we have three other modules we need to require, itâ€™ll load them one by one. that works great on the server but, unfortunately, makes it harder to use when writing JavaScript for the browser. Suffice it to say that reading a module from the web takes a lot longer than reading from disk. For as long as the script to load a module is running, it blocks the browser from running anything else until it finishes loading. It behaves this way because the JavaScript thread stops until the code has been loaded.
* imports (require) are copies of exports and consequently not alive. see **non-live-views**
